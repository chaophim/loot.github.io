<p>Setting the right load order for your mods is a crucial step to enjoying a stable modded game. The Load Order Optimisation Tool (LOOT) can help with that, by providing automated load order sorting that's simple to use and fully customisable.

<p>While sorting, LOOT checks for load order errors such as incompatibilities and missing requirements, and notifies you of any issues that it detects. It also provides thousands of plugin-specific messages such as usage notes and bug warnings, to help keep your game healthy.

<p>LOOT is the <q>spiritual successor</q> to <a href="http://boss-developers.github.io">BOSS</a>, and was originally planned for release as BOSS v3. However, because it operates in a very different way to BOSS, it was decided to instead release it as a separate utility.

<p>LOOT can sort most load orders correctly, but please check the load order it gives you for any incorrect-looking plugin positions. Positioning mistakes can be verified using TES4/FO3/FNV/TES5Edit or the mods' readmes, and relevant information contributed back to LOOT as detailed in the readme.
